## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our

diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers.

acceptable behavior and will take appropriate action in response to any behavior
that they deem inappropriate.
