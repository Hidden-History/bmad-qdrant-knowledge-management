  "information": "Error Pattern: Qdrant connection timeout in Docker environment. Symptom: Connection refused or timeout when connecting to Qdrant from application container. Root cause: Docker networking - application trying to connect to localhost:6333 but Qdrant is in separate container. Solution: 1) Use Docker service name instead of localhost (e.g., 'qdrant' if service named 'qdrant' in docker-compose), 2) Ensure both containers on same Docker network, 3) Use QDRANT_URL=http://qdrant:6333 in environment. Prevention: Always use service names in Docker environments, add health checks to wait for Qdrant readiness, implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff.",
