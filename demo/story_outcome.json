  "information": "Story Outcome: Implement user authentication with JWT tokens. Successfully implemented JWT-based authentication system. Implementation details: 1) Access tokens expire in 15 minutes, refresh tokens in 7 days, 2) Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS, 3) Refresh token rotation on each use for security, 4) Redis used for token blacklist (logout invalidation), 5) Rate limiting: 5 failed attempts triggers 15-minute lockout. Lessons learned: Initially used localStorage for tokens but switched to httpOnly cookies after security review. The refresh token rotation added complexity but significantly improves security posture. Testing revealed need for graceful handling of expired tokens during active sessions.",
