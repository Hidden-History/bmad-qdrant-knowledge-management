  "information": "Architecture Decision: Use PostgreSQL with pgvector for hybrid search. Decision made to combine traditional SQL queries with vector similarity search in a single database. PostgreSQL chosen over separate Qdrant instance for this use case because: 1) Simpler infrastructure - single database to manage, 2) ACID transactions across both search types, 3) Team already has PostgreSQL expertise, 4) Dataset size under 1M vectors where pgvector performs well. Trade-offs accepted: Less optimized vector search than dedicated Qdrant, limited to cosine/L2/inner product distances. Will revisit if vector count exceeds 5M or search latency becomes critical.",
